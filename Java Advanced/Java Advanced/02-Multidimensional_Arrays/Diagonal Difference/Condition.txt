3.	Diagonal Difference
Write a program that finds the difference between the sums of the square matrix diagonals (absolute value).
 
Input
•	The first line holds a number n – the size of matrix.
•	The next n lines hold the values for every row – n numbers separated by a space.
Examples

3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12	15	Primary diagonal: sum = 11 + 5 + (-12) = 4
			Secondary diagonal: sum = 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
			Difference: |4 - 19| = 15
Hints
•	Use a single loop i = [1 … n] to sum the diagonals.
•	The primary diagonal holds all cells {row, col} where row == col == i.
•	The secondary diagonal holds all cells {row, col} where row == i and col == n-1-i.
