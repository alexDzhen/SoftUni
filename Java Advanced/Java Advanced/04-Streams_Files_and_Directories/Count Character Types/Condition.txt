4.	Count Character Types
Write a program that reads a list of words from the file (input.txt from the Resources - Exercises)  and finds the count of vowels, consonants and punctuation marks. Assume that:
•	a, e, i, o, u are vowels, only lower case
•	All others are consonants
•	Punctuation marks are (!,.?)
•	Do not count whitespace.
Write the results to another file – output.txt.
