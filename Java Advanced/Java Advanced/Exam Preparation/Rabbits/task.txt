Rabbits
 
Preparation
Download the skeleton provided in Judge. Do not change the packages.
Pay attention to name the package (rabbits), all the classes, their fields and methods the same way they are presented in the following document. It is also important to keep the project structure as described.
Problem description
Your task is to create a repository which stores departments by creating the classes described below.

Rabbit
First, write a Java class Rabbit with the following fields:
•	name: String
•	species: String
•	available: boolean - true by default
The class constructor should receive (name, species). 
The class should also have the following methods:
•	getName()
•	getSpecies()
•	isAvailable()
•	setAvailable()
•	Override the toString() method in the format:
"Rabbit ({species}): {name}"


Cage
Next, write a Java class Cage that has data (a collection which stores the entity Rabbit). All entities inside the repository have the same fields. Also, the Cage class should have those fields:
•	name: String
•	capacity: int
•	data: List<Rabbit> that holds added rabbits
The class constructor should receive (name, capacity), also it should initialize the data with a new instance of the collection. 
Implement the following features:
•	getName()
•	getCapacity()
•	add(Rabbit rabbit) method - adds an entity to the data if there is room for it
•	removeRabbit(String name) method - removes a rabbit by given name, if such exists, and returns boolean
•	removeSpecies(String species) method - removes all rabbits by given species
•	sellRabbit(String name) method - sell (set its available property to false without removing it from the collection) the first rabbit with the given name, also return the rabbit
•	sellRabbitBySpecies(String species) method - sells and returns all rabbits from that species as a List
•	count() - returns the number of rabbits
•	report() - returns a String in the following format, including only not sold rabbits:	
	o	"Rabbits available at {cageName}:
		{Rabbit 1}
		{Rabbit 2}
		(…)"

Constraints
•	The names of the rabbits will be always unique.
•	You will always have a rabbit added before receiving methods manipulating the Cage’s rabbits.

Examples
This is an example how the Cage class is intended to be used.
