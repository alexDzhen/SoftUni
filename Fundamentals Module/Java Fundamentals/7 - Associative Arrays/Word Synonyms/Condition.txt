2.	Word Synonyms
Write a program which keeps a map with synonyms. The key of the map will be the word. The value will be a list of all the synonyms of that word. You will be given a number n. On the next 2 * n lines you will be given a word and a synonym each on a separate line like this:
•	{word}
•	{synonym}
If you get the same word for second time, just add the new synonym to the list. 
Print the words in the following format:
{word} - {synonym1, synonym2… synonymN}
