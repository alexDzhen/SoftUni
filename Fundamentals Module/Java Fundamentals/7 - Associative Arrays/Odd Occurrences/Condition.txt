3.	Odd Occurrences
Write a program that extracts from a given sequence of words all elements that are present in it an odd number of times (case-insensitive).
•	Words are given in a single line, space separated
•	Print the result elements in lowercase in their order of appearance
Examples
Input					Output
Java C# PHP PHP JAVA C java		java, c#, c

3 5 5 hi pi HO Hi 5 ho 3 hi pi		5, hi

a a A SQL xx a xx a A a XX c		a, sql, xx, c

Hints
Read a line from the console and split it by a space:
 
Use a LinkedHashMap (String  int) to count the occurrences of each word:
 
Pass through all elements in the array and count each word:
 
Create a new ArrayList (String), which will hold all the words with odd occurences:
 
Now all that is left is to print the words, separated by comma and single space (", ").
