1.	Reverse Strings
You will be given series of strings until you receive an "end" command. Write a program that reverses strings and printseach pair on separate line in format "{word} = {reversed word}".
Examples
Input		Output
helLo
Softuni
bottle
end		helLo = oLleh
		Softuni = inutfoS
		bottle = elttob

Dog
caT
chAir
end		Dog = goD
		caT = Tac
		chAir = riAhc
		Solution

Use while loop and read strings until you receive "end".
 
Reverse the string with for loop. Start from the last index and append each symbol to the new string.
 
Print the reversed string in the specified format.
