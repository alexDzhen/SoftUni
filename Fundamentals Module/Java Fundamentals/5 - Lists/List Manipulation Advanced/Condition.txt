5.	List Manipulation Advanced
Now we will implement more complicated list commands. Again, read a list, and until you receive "end" read commands:
Contains {number} – check if the list contains the number. If yes print "Yes", otherwise print "No such number"
Print even – print all the numbers that are even separated by a space
Print odd – print all the numbers that are odd separated by a space
Get sum – print the sum of all the numbers
Filter ({condition} {number}) – print all the numbers that fulfill that condition. The condition will be either '<', '>', ">=", "<="
Example
Input				Output
2 13 43 876 342 23 543
Contains 100
Contains 543
Print even
Print odd
Get sum
Filter >= 43
Filter < 100
end				No such number
				Yes
				2 876 342
				13 43 23 543
				1842
				43 876 342 543
				2 13 43 23
