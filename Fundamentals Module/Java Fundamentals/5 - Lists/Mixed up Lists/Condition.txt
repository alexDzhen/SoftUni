4.	*Mixed up Lists
Write a program that mixes up two lists by some rules. You will receive two lines of input, each one being a list of numbers. The rules for mixing are:
•	Start from the beginning of the first list and from the ending of the second
•	Add element from the first and element from the second
•	At the end there will always be a list in which there are 2 elements remaining
•	These elements will be the range of the elements you need to print
•	Loop through the result list and take only the elements that fulfill the condition
•	Print the elements ordered in ascending order and separated by a space
Example
Input				Output
1 5 23 64 2 3 34 54 12
43 23 12 31 54 51 92		23 23 31 34 43 51
Comment
After looping through the two of the arrays we get: 1 92 5 51 23 54 64 31 2 12 3 23 34 43
The constrains are 54 and 12 (so we take only the numbers between them): 51 23 31 23 34 43
We print the result sorted
