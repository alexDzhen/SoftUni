10.	Multiply Evens by Odds
Create a program that reads an integer number and multiplies the sum of all its even digits by the sum of all its odd digits:
Examples
Input	Output	Comments
12345	54	12345 has 2 even digits - 2 and 4. Even digits have sum of 6.
		Also it has 3 odd digits - 1, 3 and 5. Odd digits have sum of 9.
		Multiply 6 by 9 and you get 54.

Hints
1.	Create a method with a name describing its purpose (like getMultipleOfEvensAndOdds). The method should have a single integer parameter and an integer return value. Also, the method will call two other methods:
 
2.	Create two other methods each of which will sum either even or odd digits.
3.	Implement the logic for summing even digits: 
 
4.	Do the same for the method that will sum odd digits.
5.	As you test your solution you may notice that it doesn't work for negative numbers. Following the program execution line by line, find and fix the bug (hint: you can use Math.abs()).
