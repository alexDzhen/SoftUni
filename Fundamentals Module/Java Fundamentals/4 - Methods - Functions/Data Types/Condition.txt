1.	Data Types
Write a program that, depending on the first line of the input, reads an int, double or string.
•	If the data type is int, multiply the number by 2.
•	If the data type is real, multiply the number by 1.5 and format it to the second decimal point.
•	If the data type is string, surround the input with "$".
Print the result on the console.
